# Property Price Prediction README

## Introduction
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file for predicting property prices based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, and age of the property. This machine learning model is designed to assist in estimating property prices, which can be valuable for real estate agents, property investors, and individuals interested in buying or selling properties.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is not included in this repository. However, you can use your own dataset containing information about properties, including features like area, number of bedrooms, age, and their corresponding prices. Ensure that the dataset is preprocessed and cleaned before using it with the provided Jupyter Notebook.

## Dependencies
To run the Jupyter Notebook file, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these dependencies using pip:
\`\`\`
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
\`\`\`

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file \`Property_Price_Prediction.ipynb\` using Jupyter Notebook.
3. Ensure that your dataset is correctly loaded into the notebook and that the necessary preprocessing steps are performed according to your dataset's structure.
4. Follow the instructions and execute each cell in the notebook sequentially.
5. After training the model, you can input new property features (area, number of bedrooms, age) to predict their prices.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics help assess the accuracy of the predictions made by the model.

## Disclaimer
This machine learning model provides property price predictions based on the provided features. However, the predictions may not always be accurate and should be used as estimates rather than definitive prices. Always consult with real estate professionals and consider other factors before making any property-related decisions.
